Hi Jermal,

I took a look at DoubleJay Assemblies’ current site and put together a live demo homepage tailored to how your team actually wins jobs in Louisiana:
https://doublejay-assemblies-demo.vercel.app

The demo is built to increase quote requests and calls by tightening the conversion flow:
- clearer “Request a Quote” and “Call Now” CTAs above the fold
- mobile-first layout for fast browsing on phones
- faster load structure with less clutter
- clearer service cards + service area visibility (Baton Rouge, New Orleans, Lafayette)
- trust section designed for reviews/social proof so prospects feel confident booking

Goal is simple: more qualified quote requests and more direct phone calls from local traffic.

If useful, I can walk you through what I changed and why in a quick 10–15 minute screen share.

Would you be open to that?

Best,
Jake
